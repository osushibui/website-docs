- **My antivirus is blocking the switcher**
- That's because our switcher edits the hosts file. Turn off your antivirus and run the switcher again.

-----------------------

- **I get "Connection failed" when I try to connect to Shibui**  
- Come on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/vY29JhD) and we'll help you.

-----------------------

- **I get "Bancho authentication failed" (wrong password) when I try to log in, but my password is correct!**  
- First, make sure you're connected to Shibui (the server switcher should report "You're playing on Shibui") and that your password is correct. If so, type your username and password, then press the **login** button with your mouse. I know, it's weird but it often works. *(make also sure that caps lock is disabled if your password is lowercase)*

-----------------------

- **I can't download maps from osu!direct.**
- Some maps can't be downloaded from our beatmap mirror due to technical reasons or the map only being recently submitted. Note some maps may take up to 24 hours from original upload to become available via direct!

-----------------------

- **I can't download maps when I'm in multiplayer, but I can download them from the main menu**
- Disable **Automatically start osu!direct downloads** from the options and try again.

-----------------------

- **How do I play on the normal osu! again?**
- Close osu!, run the switcher and click the **Disconnect from Shibui** button.

-----------------------

- **My switcher is off but when I open osu.ppy.sh in my browser I get an error or I get redirected to Shibui's website!**
- Make sure the switcher is off, then empty your browser cache and restart your browser. [Google it](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=How+to+empty+browser+cache) if you don't know how to do it.

-----------------------

- **I get strange errors on osu!'s website after playing on Shibui (beatmaps not found etc)**
- Delete `s` and `t` cookies relative to osu.ppy.sh using a [cookie editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg). If you don't know how to remove specific cookies, just delete all cookies from your browser settings.

-----------------------

- **Can I keep playing while the server is restarting because it's updating?**
- Yes, your scores will be sent as soon as the server gets back online (usually less than a minute). Just make sure to not close the client.

-----------------------

- **Is there a patcher for Shibui?**
- No, not yet.Uyou can change server by editing the hosts file with our switcher in the mean time while it is being worked on. [Instructions here](https://ripple.moe/doc/1).

-----------------------

- **Can I have Shibui's source code?**
-  Shibui is entirely open source, you can see it [here!](https://github.com/osushibui/shibui).

-----------------------

- **Why are osu!direct and other in-game supporter perks free?**
- We think that osu! direct is very cool and it's a shame people have to pay to have it, that's why we're offering it for free on Shibui. If you like what we do, please consider a [donation](/donate)
